# USA_states-Weather-App



Hello! I'm not sure what you include here but I'll give it my best shot.

This is a very simple weather app I made using Python with the Tkinter module.

It allows a user to simply type the zip code of a state and press 'Submit"

Once you submit, it shows the area name, AQI (Air Quality index) and a simple message; whether the quality is good/bad/moderate,etc.
The colour of the label box changes according to the air quality status.

You can see multiple states' staus a once, and can clear it by clicking the 'Clear' Button'.


I have pulled the API from 'AirNow' which is free.
